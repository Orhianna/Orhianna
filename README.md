### Hi there, I'm Belu 👋


Curiosity killed the cat 🐱 they say… but it took me to where I am now. Knowing and learning new fields made me venture into technology with Henry, from degree in advertising to Full Stack Developer 💻. A combination that fills me with passion 💙 and wanting to face new challenges 💪.

### A little more about me...

  tools: [React, Redux, Nodejs, Styled-Components, Express, PostgreSQL],
  challenge: "I am learning ReactNative and Typescript "
}
```
